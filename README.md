git4spigot is intended to provide staff on Minecraft servers running the Spigot API 
with the ability to version their configurations.  Further, this plugin will allow for
configs to be collaboratively managed and reviewed outside of the live server environment.


This plugin will be open source, but I need to make an informed decision regarding
the license to use.  Until such time, all rights are reserved.
